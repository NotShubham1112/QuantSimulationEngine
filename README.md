# QuantSimulationEngine
QuantSim Engine — an AI-powered, memory-enabled quantitative research assistant for anyone interested in hedge funds, equities, investing, and AI-driven strategies.
🚀 Building the Future of Quant Research & AI Finance

For the past few months, I’ve been working on QuantSim Engine — an AI-powered, memory-enabled quantitative research assistant for anyone interested in hedge funds, equities, investing, and AI-driven strategies.

Here’s what makes it different:

💬 Chat-driven interface — discuss strategy ideas like you would with a mentor, and it remembers everything until you delete it.

🐍 Python script generation — every strategy you discuss can be converted into ready-to-run scripts for backtesting.

📊 Simulation engine — runs scenarios (best, average, worst), shows equity curves, metrics, and risk analysis.

🤖 Agentic AI reasoning — explains exactly why a strategy worked or failed, with math, logic, and examples.

📈 Excel-like reporting — visualize growth, risks, and trade metrics in detail.

This is not just a tool — it’s a personal research lab that turns your ideas into actionable, tested strategies.

I’m building this open-source, so everyone can contribute, test, and learn.
